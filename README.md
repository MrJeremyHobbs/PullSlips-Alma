# PullSlips
A program to generate slips for items not picked up from ILL shelf in Alma.

# How to Use
Choose your Excel spreadsheet output from Alma.

PullSlips will generate a document you can print out and cut into strips for easy searching on the hold shelf for ILL items.

# Maintainance
Ocassionally Alma will change the format of the Excel spreadsheet PullSlips uses to generate the slips.
When this happens, you have to change the column references in the PullSlips.ahk file to match.
You can use AutoHotkey's built-in EXE compiler, or else install AHK on the local machine.

# Notes
This program is nearly identical to PullList, which performs the same operation, except output the data as a list.
